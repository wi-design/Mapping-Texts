In the setup folder (at this level) there is a python script named load.py, that connects to the redis server and pushes all the data in the text files to server.

For this to work the script assumes the path to the text files is as follows:




--For Word Corrected Counts-- 
...there needs to be a folder path of "Texas_Newspaper_Data/Word_Counts_Corrected/wcc_title_location_year" where "Texas_Newspaper_Data" folder is located in the same folder as the load.py script, and each publication and year is a file inside this folder




--For the Named Entity Relation Counts--
...the file path for the load.py needs to be "Texas_Newspaper_Data/Named_Entity_Counts_Corrected/ner_by-title_by-location_by-year.tsv"




--For topic models--

...by title, city, epoch
"Texas_Newspaper_Data/Topics/Title_By_Location_By_Epoch" is where the list of files containing these topics models are. 
E.g. "10.topic-keys.Brazos_Courier,_Brazoria,_Texas,_1836-04-22_1845-12-29.tsv"

...city, epoch
"Texas_Newspaper_Data/Topics/Location_by_Epoch" is where the list of files containing these topics models are. 
E.g. "10.topic-keys.Abilene,_Texas,_1900-01-01_1929-10-29.tsv"

...epoch
"Texas_Newspaper_Data/Topics/Epoch" is where the list of files containing these topics models are. 
E.g. "10.topic-keys.1829-01-01_1836-04-21.tsv"



--Use python script to create database-- 
Run the below command. It will take a while and output how far along the process is.
python load.py --input-redis=all

Now you have a database setup. Run these migrations in sequence:
python load.py --input-redis=1000-trunc-scheme
python load.py --input-redis=topics
python load.py --input-redis=epochs
python load.py --input-redis=templates
python load.py --migrate-redis=locs-into-pubs
python load.py --migrate-redis=pubseq-into-pubs
python load.py --migrate-redis=x_tho
python load.py --make-redis=wcc-ner-all
